Random Incremental

IMPORTANT: CTRL + S saves the game (it also saves automatically every 25 seconds), CTRL + R resets the entire game.

This game is a simple incremental game where you have to buy and upgrade your workers to get more coins.
Start by buying the first worker, which will always cost 10 coins on start. When buying workers, you will see a text that says "x until 10". When x reaches 0, it will reset back to 10, giving you 1 Knowledge Point and the worker will get a x2 multiplier and will also increase its price.
Knowledge Points are used to create new workers.

You can buy certain upgrades that will reset your progress but make your overall progression better.
